Cistercian numerals, or "ciphers" were developed by the Cistercian monks in the early 13th century to write numbers 1 to 9,999 in a single glyph or symbol.  
The glyph combines elements to a vertical line to define its numerical value.  
This program allows a user to convert an input of 1 to 9,999 into the Cistercian number equivalent.
